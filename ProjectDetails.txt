Google drive link to the demo video of my project: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Zu_jZursqdLyltQjHTHwaDaxSs7ldj7j

It is a mini project which I had developed in a few weeks. I am still making changes and enhancing the project. It is developed in ASP.NET(C# language) and I have used javascript, jquery, 
HTML,CSS to develop the front end. The project has the following features:

(i) The user can either register or login via their google login (external authentication).

(ii) The user can see a list of restaurants(when clicked on the "Restaurants" tab) and search the restaurants as well based on various categories.

(iii) The user can view the details of the restaurant and make a booking for a particular time and date. Once booked, an email will be sent to the user confirming the reservation.

(iv) The user can also give rating to the restaurants.

(v) In the "Events" tab, a list of various events will be shown and their location can be seen on google maps.(I have used google api)

(vi) In order to login as an administrator, please follow the credentials on the top of the login page.

(vii) The admin has the rights to create a restaurant, create an event, edit details of a restaurant and delete a restaurant.

(viii) The user can see the bar chart and line chart comparing the restaurants names and their ratings.

(ix) There is also a functionality of generating PDF.

(x) Bulk email is sent to the customers(admin can select the customers from a checklist) whenever a new restaurant is launched.

(xi) An attachment can be attached with the email as well.
